Here is a 100-line poem celebrating the Python coding language:

A serpent's name, yet soft and wise,
In digital realms, where logic lies.
From Guido's mind, a language born,
To greet the future, every morn.

No harsh, stiff syntax, cold and gray,
But readable, like prose, they say.
With whitespace rules, a gentle guide,
Where clarity and grace abide.

A prompt appears, a blinking line,
Ready for thoughts, for yours and mine.
print("Hello, World!") â€“ a simple start,
Unlocking wonders in the heart.

No curly braces, clanking loud,
No semicolons, in a crowd.
Just colons mark, and indents deep,
The blocks of code, the secrets keep.

From humble scripts to grand designs,
It gracefully entwines and shines.
For web profound, with Django's might,
Or Flask's light touch, bathed in pure light.

With NumPy, pandas, data flows,
Through charts and graphs, its wisdom shows.
In science's lab, a trusted friend,
Where complex numbers have no end.

For AI's dream, a guiding star,
From TensorFlow to scikit-learn, afar.
With neural nets, it learns and grows,
The future's seed, the future sows.

Automation's heart, a tireless hand,
Across the servers, through the land.
It sorts the files, and scrapes the web,
No task too small, no flow too ebb.

The interpreter, a patient soul,
Executes each line, takes its toll
On errors made, with tracebacks clear,
Whispering guidance, quelling fear.

A vast, warm sea, the PyPI trove,
Where modules bloom, and talents rove.
For every need, a library waits,
Unlocking power, opening gates.

The community, a vibrant throng,
Where questions answered, we belong.
From forum posts to Stack Overflow's aid,
A helping hand, a bond unmade.

It crosses platforms, swift and free,
On Linux, Windows, macOS, you see.
A truly versatile, global tongue,
By millions loved, by poets sung.

Dynamic types, a flexible way,
To mold your data, come what may.
Though sometimes loose, with care and might,
It guides your logic, sets it right.

A gentle hum, when processes blend,
A stable partner, to the very end.
From education's first soft gleam,
To industry's bold, complex dream.

So raise a glass, or clink a key,
To Python's elegance, wild and free.
A language built on human thought,
A coding journey, beautifully wrought.
Its power grows, its charm expands,
Connecting minds, across all lands.
