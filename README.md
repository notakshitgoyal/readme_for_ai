Beneath the moonâ€™s uncertain glow,
A fox once danced on fields of snow.
The stars above began to hum,
As trees swayed to a silent drum.

A clock forgot to tick or chime,
Suspended in the hands of time.
A crow recited lines from Keats,
While toads composed in minor beats.

The rivers flowed with neon blue,
And clouds wore shades of greenish hue.
A fish once climbed a cherry tree,
And sang a song in F sharp D.

A suitcase fell from outer space,
With socks that smelled of pumpkin lace.
A child drew planets in the sand,
That orbited upon command.

A mirror laughed and cracked a grin,
Revealing galaxies within.
A spider wove a web of gold,
That whispered secrets brave and bold.

The wind took shape, became a cat,
It wore a monocle and hat.
A mountain bowed to passing ants,
Who ruled the rocks with battle chants.

A book grew roots and sprouted leaves,
Its pages danced upon the eaves.
An old oak tree told bedtime tales,
To drifting clouds and blushing whales.

The stars grew tired and blinked to sleep,
The earth let out a sigh so deep.
And all the world, both wild and wise,
Closed dreamlit eyes beneath the skies.
