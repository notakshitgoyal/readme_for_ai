A serpent's name, yet soft and wise,
In digital realms, where logic lies.
From Guido's mind, a language born,
To greet the future, every morn.

It slithers not through grass or glade,
But through the code that we have made.
Indent by indent, line by line,
It weaves a spell both pure and fine.

With syntax clear and thoughts expressed,
It helps the mind feel truly blessed.
No braces bold, no semis tight,
Just flowing words that read just right.

From scripts that run in seconds fast,
To data truths from ages past.
It talks to clouds and walks through AI,
And builds the dreams we dare to try.

For every age and every skill,
Its gentle ways the gaps can fill.
Oh Python, soft yet boldly true,
The future writes itself in you.
